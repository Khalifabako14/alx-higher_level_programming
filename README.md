# Higher Level Programming Projects
This repo contains all the projects that I have done in the ALX-Holberton curriculum on Higher level programming.


## What Does High-Level Language (HLL) Mean?
A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.

A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.

| [0x02-python-import_modules](0x02-python-import_modules) | All about importing and using functions and creating modules in Python. |
| [0x03-python-data_structures](0x03-python-data_structures) | All about data structures and using lists and tuples in Python. |
| [0x04-python-more_data_structures](0x04-python-more_data_structures) | All about data sets and dictionaries in Python. |
| [0x05-python-exceptions](0x05-python-exceptions) | All about handling errors and exceptions in Python with try and except. |
| [0x06-python-classes](0x06-python-classes) | All about handling attributes, methods, and properties as well as data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding. |
| [0x07-python-test_driven_development](0x07-python-test_driven_development) | All about practicing test-driven development using docstringand unittest in Python. |
